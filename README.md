## Welcome 

#### My name is Mathias Hagewood, a recent Computer Engineering graduate from Tennessee Tech. While at University and across several internships, I have acquired a knack for adapting to new technologies and programs.  

#### With a well-rounded knowledge of the building blocks that make real the modern computer system (OSs, databases, networks, object-oriented programming), a more specialized understanding of embedded systems (microcontroller properties, vhdl, C, assembly), and a few random add-ons (python, digital signals, QGIS), I find myself working on a variety of projects. These range from capturing heart-rates using a radar device to simulating analog signals with a raspberry pi pico2 to designing web apps with tools such as Google Apps Studio or Anvil.

#### Through my account you'll find many of the projects I've worked on. I hope to showcase my abilities but also better organize and catalog the work I've done while providing a place to store future tinkerings.
