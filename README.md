## Welcome 

#### My name is Mathias Hagewood, a recent Computer Engineering graduate from Tennessee Tech. While at University and across several internships, I have acquired a knack for adapting to new technologies and tools.  

#### I have a solid foundation in the core components of modern computer systems-operating systems, databases, networks, object-oriented programming-as well as a more specialized experience in embedded systems, including microcontrollers, VHDL, C, and assembly. I've also picked up a few extra skills along the way, like Python scripting, digital signal processing, and using tools like QGIS. 

#### My projects reflect this variety: from capturing heart rates with radar sensors and simulating analog signals using a Raspberry Pi Pico, to building web apps with platforms like Google Apps Script and Anvil.

#### This GitHub account serves both as a portfolio to showcase my work and as a space to organize, document, and expand on my ongoing projects and experiments.
